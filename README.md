# Enjoy a better Spotify with this Spicetify setup!!

**Simple setup guide included of course** 


# HOW TO IMPLEMENT THIS SPICETIFY SETUP


## IMPORTANT NOTES

- Use all the commands listed in this guide in **PowerShell** *(no admin needed)*  

- All versions of StarryNight might have a bug, may want to wait until it is properly fixed  

- FYI the `zoomTheme.js` extension is just for the SpotifyDarkPurp Theme  

---

## HOW TO INSTALL SPICETIFY

- There are several ways to do it but I suggest using this  

- Open **PowerShell** *(regularly without admin)*  

- Run the following command:  
```
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spicetify/spicetify-cli/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

- Enter **y** when prompted and hit enter to install the marketplace too  

- Then run:  
```
spicetify backup apply
```
You can also check out their page [Spicetify Installation Guide + Info](https://spicetify.app/docs/advanced-usage/installation)

## HOW TO APPLY THEMES

- Move or copy the folders inside **My Modified Themes** into this location:  
```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\spicetify\Themes
```

- Then run:  
```
spicetify config current_theme <nameofthemefolder>  
spicetify apply
```

### FORCE APPLY A MODIFIED COLOR SCHEME *(Might need to do for StarryNight)*

```
spicetify config current_theme <nameofthemefolder>  
spicetify config color_scheme <nameofcolorschemefile>  
spicetify apply
```

## HOW TO INSTALL `waveform.js` *(CUSTOM LOCAL FILE EXTENSIONS)*
*Use `Appdata\Roaming` locations for local file Custom Apps & Extensions, not `Appdata\Local`*


The `waveform.js` extension is a custom extension from GitHub, it's no longer maintained and doesn't fully work. 
There is another one like it in the Spicetify Marketplace, but it doesn't work on all themes so I suggest using this one.
Sucks that there isn't a playing audio wave visualizer extension that's maintained, if you find a better one please [inform me on Discord!!](https://discordapp.com/users/831735011588964392)

- Place the `spicetify-waveform` folder and the `waveform.js` file into this location:  
```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\spicetify\Extensions
```

- Then run:  
```
spicetify config extensions waveform.js
```

---

## HOW TO INSTALL `history-in-sidebar` *(CUSTOM LOCAL FILE APPS)*
*Use `Appdata\Roaming` locations for local file Custom Apps & Extensions, not `Appdata\Local`*

- Place the `history-in-sidebar` folder into this location:  
```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\spicetify\CustomApps
```

- Then run:  
```
spicetify config custom_apps history-in-sidebar
```

---

## HOW TO APPLY MY SPICETIFY SETTINGS / SETUP

- Open Spotify  

- Click the shopping cart (Marketplace Icon)  

- Select the gear icon **Spicetify Settings**  

- Under **Backup/Restore**, press **Open > Import From File**  

- Select the `marketplace-settings-2025-10-13T06_40_03.630Z.json` provided in this package  

If for some reason it doesn't import correctly, use the `IMPORT FILE PREVIEW.png` to see which ones to get from what the import file has.

## IF USING THE LUCID THEME — HOW TO APPLY MY LUCID THEME SETTINGS

- Once you have Lucid Theme applied, select the tiny gear icon at the top right of Spotify

- In the top Settings navigation categories, scroll all the way to the right and select **Advanced**, or scroll all the way to the bottom  

- Open the `My Lucid Theme Setup.json` with Notepad  

- Press `Ctrl + A` to select all the contents and copy it  

- Paste them into the **Import Configuration** section of Lucid’s Advanced Settings section  

- You can customize the Lucid settings however you like from there :)  

---

## NOTES
- **Recommend to join the [Spicetify Discord](https://discord.com/invite/spicetify-842219447716151306)**

- Once in a while you will have to use `spicetify apply` or `spicetify backup apply` or `spicetify update`

- You can customize the Spicetify addons however you like in the marketplace  

- There is also a `Spicetify Commands.txt` included in this pack if you ever need  

- This setup is just my personal favourite after having gone through everything like 20 times lol — enjoy
